# Kanban board

This is a mini project, i try to build for exploring react capabilities.

In this project user can create multiple project and each broject has one board consists of three status column [Todo, In progress, completed],

It will have drag and drop compability, to reorder tasks and change status.

I had work with electron js and I want to focus only on react now, So I planned to crate a desktop application using elecron js instead of web app, so i don't worry about db, backend server and all.

Tech Stack:

1. React
2. React Router
3. Vite
4. Tailwindcss
5. Radix ui components
6. Electron
